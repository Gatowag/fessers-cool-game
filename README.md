# FESSER'S COOL GAME

This is a small text adventure game written in batch script for [a youtube video](https://youtu.be/8oZTIduSLDk) on the [Modern Rogue channel](https://youtube.com/modernrogue). There are a half dozen endings and the game should tell you that you've seen the true ending only after you've seen them all.

It's not listed anywhere, but you can press the X key at any point to quickly close the game.
